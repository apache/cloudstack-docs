    <title>Configure hypervisor: KVM</title>
    <para>
      In addition to "KVM Hypervisor Host Installation" in "&PRODUCT; Installation Guide", you have to configure the following item on the host.
    </para>
    <section id="plugin-vxlan-config-hypervisor-kvm-bridge">
      <title>Create bridge interface with IPv4 address</title>
      <para>
        This plugin requires an IPv4 address on the KVM host to terminate and originate VXLAN traffic.
        The address should be assinged to a physical interface or a bridge interface bound to a physical interface.
        Both a private address or a public address are fine for the purpose.
        It is not required to be in the same subnet for all hypervisors in a zone, but they should be able to reach each other via IP multicast with UDP/8472 port.
        A name of a physical interface or a name of a bridge interface bound to a physical interface can be used as a traffic label.
        Physical interface name fits for almost all cases, but if physical interface name differs per host, you may use a bridge to set a same name.
        If you would like to use a bridge name as a traffic label, you may create a bridge in this way.

        Let <parameter>cloudbr1</parameter> be the bridge interface for the instances' private network.

   	    <para>
	      RHEL and CentOS use iptables for firewalling the system, you can open extra ports by executing the following iptable commands:

	    <programlisting language="Bash">$ sudo iptables -I INPUT -p udp -m udp --dport 8472 -j ACCEPT
	    </programlisting>
	    <para>
	      These iptable settings are not persistent accross reboots, we have to save them first.

	    <programlisting language="Bash">$ sudo iptables-save > /etc/sysconfig/iptables
	    </programlisting>
	    <para>
