The OVS Plugin
==============

Introduction to the OVS Plugin
------------------------------

The OVS plugin is the native SDN
implementations in CloudStack, using GRE isolation method. The plugin can be 
used by CloudStack to implement isolated guest networks and to provide 
additional services like NAT, port forwarding and load balancing.


Features of the OVS Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table lists the CloudStack network services provided by
the OVS Plugin.

+----------------------+----------------------+
| Network Service      | CloudStack version   |
+======================+======================+
| Virtual Networking   | >= 4.0               |
+----------------------+----------------------+
| Static NAT           | >= 4.3               |
+----------------------+----------------------+
| Port Forwarding      | >= 4.3               |
+----------------------+----------------------+
| Load Balancing       | >= 4.3               |
+----------------------+----------------------+

Table: Supported Services

.. note::
   The Virtual Networking service was originally called 'Connectivity'
   in CloudStack 4.0

The following hypervisors are supported by the OVS Plugin.

+--------------+----------------------+
| Hypervisor   | CloudStack version   |
+==============+======================+
| XenServer    | >= 4.0               |
+--------------+----------------------+
| KVM          | >= 4.3               |
+--------------+----------------------+

Configuring the OVS Plugin
--------------------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before enabling the OVS plugin the hypervisor needs to be install OpenvSwitch. 
Default, XenServer has already installed OpenvSwitch. However, you must 
install OpenvSwitch manually on KVM. CentOS 6.4 and OpenvSwitch 1.10 are 
recommended.

KVM hypervisor:

-  CentOS 6.4 is recommended.

-  To make sure that the native bridge module will not interfere with 
   openvSwitch the bridge module should be added to the blacklist. See the 
   modprobe documentation for your distribution on where to find the blacklist. 
   Make sure the module is not loaded either by rebooting or executing rmmod 
   bridge before executing next steps.


Zone Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CloudStack needs to have at least one physical network with the isolation
method set to “GRE”. This network should be enabled for the Guest
traffic type.

.. note::
   With KVM, the traffic type should be configured with the traffic label
   that matches the name of the Integration Bridge on the hypervisor. For 
   example, you should set the traffic label as following:

   -  Management & Storage traffic: cloudbr0

   -  Guest & Public traffic: cloudbr1
      See KVM networking configuration guide for more detail.

Agent Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
   Only for KVM hypervisor

-  Configure network interfaces:

   ::
      
      /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
      DEVICE=eth0
      BOOTPROTO=none
      IPV6INIT=no
      NM_CONTROLLED=no
      ONBOOT=yes
      TYPE=OVSPort
      DEVICETYPE=ovs
      OVS_BRIDGE=cloudbr0
    
      /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1
      DEVICE=eth1
      BOOTPROTO=none
      IPV6INIT=no
      NM_CONTROLLED=no
      ONBOOT=yes
      TYPE=OVSPort
      DEVICETYPE=ovs
      OVS_BRIDGE=cloudbr1
    
      /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-cloudbr0
      DEVICE=cloudbr0
      ONBOOT=yes
      DEVICETYPE=ovs
      TYPE=OVSBridge
      BOOTPROTO=static
      IPADDR=172.16.10.10
      GATEWAY=172.16.10.1
      NETMASK=255.255.255.0
      HOTPLUG=no
    
      /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-cloudbr1
      DEVICE=cloudbr1
      ONBOOT=yes
      DEVICETYPE=ovs
      TYPE=OVSBridge
      BOOTPROTO=none
      HOTPLUG=no
    
      /etc/sysconfig/network
      NETWORKING=yes
      HOSTNAME=testkvm1
      GATEWAY=172.10.10.1

-  Edit /etc/cloudstack/agent/agent.properties

   ::
      
      network.bridge.type=openvswitch
      libvirt.vif.driver=com.cloud.hypervisor.kvm.resource.OvsVifDriver


Enabling the service provider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OVS provider is disabled by default. Navigate to the "Network
Service Providers" configuration of the physical network with the GRE
isolation type. Navigate to the OVS provider and press the
"Enable Provider" button.

Network Offerings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the OVS plugin requires a network offering with Virtual
Networking enabled and configured to use the OVS element. Typical
use cases combine services from the Virtual Router appliance and the
OVS plugin.

+----------------------+-----------------+
| Service              | Provider        |
+======================+=================+
| VPN                  | VirtualRouter   |
+----------------------+-----------------+
| DHCP                 | VirtualRouter   |
+----------------------+-----------------+
| DNS                  | VirtualRouter   |

| Source NAT           | VirtualRouter   |
+----------------------+-----------------+
| Static NAT           | OVS             |
+----------------------+-----------------+
| Post Forwarding      | OVS             |

.. note::
   The tag in the network offering should be set to the name of the
   physical network with the OVS provider.

Isolated network with network services. The virtual router is still
required to provide network services like dns and dhcp.
