    <title>Features of the VXLAN Plugin</title>

    <para>
      In &PRODUCT; release 4.X.0 this plugin supports Advanced Isolated network mode.
      This plugin enables more than 4096 isolated guest networks in a Zone, with almost the same usability as VLAN isolation.
    </para>

    <para>
      By the nature of VXLAN's MAC-in-IP encapsulation, the MAC addresses of VMs are encapsulated and concealed in the MAC addresses of Hypervisors.
      So, the physical switch no longer needs to learn the MAC addresses of the individual VMs.
      Thus, the required MAC address table size of the physical switch would be greatly reduced.
    </para>

    <para>
      This plugin doesn't provide network services.
      With this plugin, network services ( VPN, Source NAT, Static NAT, Port Forwarding, Firewall, and Load Balancing ) are provided by the Virtual Router.
