$ sudo modprobe vxlan &amp;&amp; echo $?

# Dig into "Device Drivers" -> "Network device support",
# then select "Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network (VXLAN)" and hit space.
# Make sure it indicates "&lt;M&gt;" (build as module), then Save and Exit.

# You may also want to check "IPv4 NAT" and its child nodes in "IP: Netfilter Configuration"
# and "IPv6 NAT" and its child nodes in "IPv6: Netfilter Configuration".
# In 3.10.4, you can find the options in
# "Networking support" -> "Networking options"
#   -> "Network packet filtering framework (Netfilter)".

$ make # -j N
# You may use -j N option to make the build process parallel and faster,
# generally N = 1 + (cores your machine have).

$ sudo make modules_install
$ sudo make install
# You would get an error like "ERROR: modinfo: could not find module XXXX" here.
# This happens mainly due to config structure changes between kernel versions.
# You can ignore this error, until you find you need the kernel module.
# If you feel uneasy, you can go back to make menuconfig,
# find module XXXX by using '/' key, enable the module, build and install the kernel again.

$ sudo vi /etc/grub.conf
# Make sure the new kernel isn't set as the default and the timeout is long enough,
# so you can select the new kernel during boot process.
# It's not a good idea to set the new kernel as the default until you confirm the kernel works fine.

$ sudo reboot
# Select the new kernel during the boot process.
